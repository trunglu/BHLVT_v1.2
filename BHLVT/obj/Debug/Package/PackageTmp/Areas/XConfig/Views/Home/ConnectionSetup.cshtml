        <h2>You may use this template in any manner you like. All I ask is that you leave the link back to my site at the bottom of the page. </h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Template Notes</h3>
        <p>The main image can be changed by either replacing the current image with another one of the same size (900x402), or using a new one of what ever dimensions you'd like.  If you choose the latter, you must open up style.css and change the dimensions of #mainpic, as well as the file name if that is different. If you would like to move the heading around in the above image, find &quot;#mainpic h1&quot; in style.css and modify it's &quot;left&quot; and &quot;top&quot; properties, this is also true for the h2 tag.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>More information</h3>
        <p>I decided to leave the content portion open for the templates users to do as they wish with a blank canvas. I don't like to restrict my users too much, and for this reason I leave the defining of any content related styles to you.</p>
